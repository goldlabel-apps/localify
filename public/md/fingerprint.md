## Fingerprint

> What is your fingerprint and what do we do with it?

Your fingerprint is a unique identifier which takes details from your device like which phone you're using and combines it into a long, unique string. When you come back your device creates the same string, so we know it's you without any log in

This makes us cautious of the GDPR
