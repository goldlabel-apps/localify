Sunshine Coast Surfing, Coolum Beach

https://coolumatthebeach.com.au/things-to-do/surfing-at-coolum-beach

The Coolum beach stretch takes in a number of bays and the main beach itself goes all the way to neighbouring Peregian Beach and beyond

Offering a number of surfing options to suit all levels there is a wave for everyone at Coolum Beach. More experienced surfers will be rewarded with a steep take off and long right-handers at Point Perry and Point Arkwright

First Bay provides a sheltered area that escapes the majority of winds and is easily surfable for intermediate and advanced surfers and neighbouring beach Yaroomba is sheltered from northerly winds and with the right conditions is a goofy footers dream 

Beginners will be best heading straight out from Coolum Main Beach with a long foamy wall forming, there are plenty of opportunities for learners and beginners to get a feel for surfing without being intimidated by larger swells
